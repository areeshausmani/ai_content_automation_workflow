# AI Content Automation Workflow (Built with Make.com)

This workflow was designed and implemented in **Make.com** to automate content processing.  
It fetches Google Docs content, summarizes it into bullet points using GPT-4o, and stores  
LinkedIn-ready posts in Airtable for review.

## Tools and Integrations
- **Make.com** — workflow automation platform  
- **Google Docs** — content input  
- **OpenRouter GPT-4o** — AI text processing  
- **Airtable** — structured content storage

## What this workflow does

- **Monitors Google Drive** — watches a specific folder for newly created Google Docs.  
- **Extracts document content** — reads and cleans the text for processing.  
- **Uses AI to generate platform-specific posts:**
  - LinkedIn posts (no hashtags, no emojis)
  - Tweet-style micro-posts
  - Carousel summaries (short key points)
- **Stores the outputs in Airtable** for easy review and publishing.

## Why I built this

I wanted to **automate repetitive content formatting tasks**.  
Instead of writing separate LinkedIn posts, tweets, and summaries manually, this workflow does it in one shot — saving time and keeping tone consistent.

## How to use this project

1. Import `ai_content_workflow.json` into Make.com.  
2. Update Google Docs and Airtable connections with your own credentials.  
3. (Optional) Use `clean_text.py` to preprocess your document content.  
4. Run the workflow and check Airtable for generated posts.

## Example use cases

- Automating **weekly newsletters → LinkedIn posts**  
- Converting **long-form blogs → tweet threads**  
- Generating **multi-platform drafts for personal branding or client content**  

---

## Future improvements

- Add error-handling (retry failed AI calls).  
- Automatically post approved drafts directly to LinkedIn/Twitter APIs.  
- Extend to other platforms like Notion or Google Sheets.
